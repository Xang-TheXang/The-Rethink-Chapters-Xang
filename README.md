# The Rethink Chapters  
**Created by Xang**

> **Version 0.9.0**  
> *The Rethink Chapters* adds depth with many levels across 24 chapters (for now >:)), offering fresh and engaging content to explore.  
> *(⚠️ Versions v8.3 and before had 100+ levels and 20+ chapters. You can find those older releases [here](https://github.com/Xang-TheXang/Storyteller-Xang-Rethink-Chapters/releases). However, I (Xang) recommend starting with v0.9.0. I believe v0.9.0 offers a better overall experience and gameplay.)*
